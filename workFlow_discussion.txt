> If there are multiple requests (> 1) coming for the same camera to capture images, with different
priority. So all the requests can be queued in a Distributed Messaging System like rabbitMQ or kafka.
Kafka won't support message prioritization directly, but we can create special topics depending on the 
request priority (e.g. LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH) and on the consumer side consume the requests first from
the HIGHEST priority TOPIC and lastly from the LOWEST PRIORITY TOPIC
OR we can also use RabbitMQ which does support prioritization of messages based on priority value

then we can either go for optimized locking or pessimistic locking. So with each capturable entity, 
we will maintain in Database, a field isAvailable, that denotes its availability for usage. If no client is
using it, the flag will be true, else it will be false. By default, the camera will have the flag as true, 
We will make sure, as soon as a camera is being used the flag is turned to false and once it done using
its turned back to true.
So before asking the capturable to capture images, we check if it is available or NOT. We can go for the
optimisitic locking here, as this usecase might not have that much contention for using a shared resource
but yeah depending on more situational data, this can be decided.
We can use MongoDB here for serving the optimistic locking use case here.
